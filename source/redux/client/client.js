// This function is what's gonna be called from the project's code on the client-side.
//
// There are two passes of client-side render happening here.
// React has the concept of "re-hydration" which demands that
// the initial client-side React rendering results be equal to
// the server-side React rendering results, character-by-character.
// Otherwise it complains.
// That's the reason why the application on client side first performs
// a "dummy" rendering without resolving any `@preload`s, just to complete
// the React "hydration" process, and only when the "hydration" process finishes
// does it perform the second pass of rendering the page,
// now resolving all client-side `@preload`s.
// Therefore, the first pass of `.render()`Â always happens with data missing
// if that data is loaded in "client-side only" `@preload`s.
// (that is, the `@preload`s configured with `{ client: true }`).
//
// If React "re-hydration" step didn't exist
// then the library would first execute all client-side preloads
// and only then would it render the application.
// That would be more intuitive and convenient for developers I guess.
